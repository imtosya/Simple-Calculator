Project: Calculator

My Java program is a console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations and includes advanced mathematical functions such as power, square root, absolute value, and rounding. The program allows 
users to enter an arithmetic expression and displays the result. Users can input expressions like 34 + abs(-5) or pow(2, 3), and the program evaluates the result accordingly. It supports basic operations such as 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus, while also handling functions like abs(), sqrt(), pow(), and round().

The program features a history function that records past calculations, allowing users to view previous results. It also handles invalid input and errors gracefully, providing feedback when an expression is 
malformed or when division by zero occurs. To use the program, users enter an arithmetic expression, and the program processes it, displaying the result. Users can then choose to continue with more calculations or 
exit. The program uses Javaâ€™s built-in Scanner for input handling and the Stack data structure to manage operator precedence. The main logic processes the expressions and evaluates the functions first, ensuring 
accurate results.
